# columns

Columns is a Tetris variant. In this game, all the pieces are composed of *piece::PIECE_SIZE* straight vertical tiles.
Each tile as a color. To eliminate tiles from the board it is necessary to gather at least 3 tiles of the same color in
a straight line in any direction (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).

The pieces don't rotate on the plane of the game, thus they always fall in vertical position. What the player can do is
rotate the colors with up and down arrow.

Try it out, it is simple and fun.
